          <h2>First Time Cleaning</h2>
          <p>When starting a new residential cleaning account we are often asked why we charge more for the "first time" cleaning. A first time cleaning of a new residential cleaning account is more like a "spring-cleaning" and needs extra staff time to remove extra soil and build-up.
           Our staff may spend anywhere from 4 to 8 times longer to clean a first-time residential account than one of our existing client's homes.</p>
           <h2>Why the extra time?</h2>
           <p>A customer who has never had their home professionally-cleaned is likely to have soil build-up throughout the house. We often gain new clients who are dissatisfied with their cleaning service and decide to hire our company.
           We take the time to remove extra soil and build-up around your home so that we are starting out with a “fresh palette.” Here are some of the challenges we run into:</p>
           <h3>Bathrooms</h3>
           <p>We put extra effort will into removing hard water stains from fixtures, tubs and sinks. We also frequently find build-up around the bottom of toilets, faucets, and other fixtures that must be removed. Shower doors may have lime, rust, and hard water spots.
           We take the entire room back to a clean starting point so in the future, regular cleaning will keep everything shiny and deposit free.</p>
           <h3>Kitchen</h3>
           <p>We clean the small cracks and crevices in the kitchen that some residential cleaning services overlook.
            The tops of cabinets, cupboards and refrigerators are places that often go undusted or uncleaned for long periods of time.
            We find grease and fingerprints on most surfaces, especially stove tops, refrigerator doors, and small appliances. A good overall cleaning is essential to remove the hidden dirt, grease and even unseen spilled food that need to be thoroughly cleaned up.</p>
           <h3>Living rooms and bedrooms</h3>
           <p>Home owners are often too busy to do a thorough cleaning job. As people get busy, they sweep and vacuum what's visible, but they tend to ignore vacuuming and sweeping behind or under furniture.
            Dusting is often a task that homeowners leave for "when there is time." We clean window sills, bookshelves, baseboards, ceiling fans, and other furniture that may have a long-term build-up of thick dust.</p>
           <h3>Hallways and entryways</h3>
           <p>We clean these spaces that have build-up around baseboards and edges. It is important to keep these areas clean as dust and dirt is tracked in from hallways and entryways.
Removing the build-up of soil and grime is essential before we can get a home to looking its best. Once the home has had a careful cleaning it will be faster and easier for our team to go in and clean on the schedule agreed upon.
 Getting back to a basic starting point is important so that we have a clean slate to work with. Beginning at the starting point we can make sure that every time we clean, your home will shine and you will be a satisfied customer!</p>
